## PITCH !

**Concept:**  
The idea is to develop a **media summarization tool** accessible via a **Telegram Bot** and **Browser Extension**. This tool builds on the [YouTube Summary with ChatGPT project](https://github.com/kazuki-sf/YouTube_Summary_with_ChatGPT) with significant enhancements for versatility and user control.

**Key Enhancements:**
1. **Powered by Claude**  
   - Utilizing Claude for fast, cost-effective video summarization.

2. **Chrome Extension Deployment**  
   - Accessible directly on YouTube for seamless user experience.

3. **Telegram Bot Availability**  
   - Quick access for users, leveraging existing bot development experience.

4. **User-Controlled API Key Support**  
   - Scalable setup, allowing users to provide their own API keys for personalization and cost management.

**Bonus Vision:**  
Make APIs modular so that various AI models (e.g., Claude, GPT) can be easily integrated and swapped based on user preference or project needs.

This approach provides an ideal balance of **feasibility** and **technical showcase** potential.
